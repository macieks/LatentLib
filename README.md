LatentLib
=========

C++ Latent Function Support Library

Allows to create, arbitrarily nested, resumable latent function calls in C++ with parameters of any type. It can be useful if you want multiple functions to execute simultaneously on a single thread.

Besides, LatentLib fully supports aborting latent function without causing memory leaks.

It is 100% portable and within C/C++ standard.
